This Android app was made for CSE 5324 - Software Engineering: Analysis, Design, and Testing. Made by Group 6 - Coffee_Code.
The purpose of this project was to learn major SFT ENG principles. All design materials can be found in the CSE 5324 folder.
The final design notebook is in the Iteration 3 'final' folder, and contains all planning work (Requirements, Use Cases, ..., Design Class Diagram, etc.) for this project.

# ShareList

This to-do app is designed to allow users to create, delegate, and track tasks that are shared
amongst users in a group. The app needs the internet to connect with the server so all users
can stay synchronized. The main purpose of the app is to allow group members in a virtual environment
to have better collaboration. The app can be used by anyone wishing to create/delegate tasks
with others and not just for industry use. Whether you are a group of students working on a semester
project, or a family managing the chores, or an organization managing their work on the go, this app
is an efficient, fast, user-friendly and smooth task-management tool for you!
