# ShareList

This to-do app is designed to allow users to create, delegate, and track tasks that are shared
amongst users in a group. The app needs the internet to connect with the server so all users
can stay synchronized. The main purpose of the app is to allow group members in a virtual environment
to have better collaboration. The app can be used by anyone wishing to create/delegate tasks
with others and not just for industry use. Whether you are a group of students working on a semester
project, or a family managing the chores, or an organization managing their work on the go, this app
is an efficient, fast, user-friendly and smooth task-management tool for you!
